## Question

Use tiktokenizer to with code and place results in (new branch &) pull request (PR). In your own words, describe with the tokenized description how LLMs, tokenizers, mixture of experts, and Coding Assistance fits together. I will be looking for a description in the PR.

## Description

First, we have a prompt that we give to a large language model in order to give it a "context" to work with, something that we want out. The LLM then separates the prompt into tokens through a tokenizer, that is then given to a mixture of experts / the neural network to interpret, utilizing biases and weights in its vectors to best predict the necessary output for the user. The biggest issue with using this for coding assistance is in the vector system, as a temperature that is too high (along with other variables that go into its output) in an LLM could significantly hurt the accuracy of the LLM's output, which is simply not what we need for code. That's where we go into domain-specific models, where models like these could be developed for the sole purpose of coding assistance or even a specific programming language, so that the AI is most accurate for that programming language. This could be the best way to avoid confusion in AI, such as the inability to do simple arithmetic or giving the wrong syntax, because the model could be fine tuned to a specific temperature and given a specific set of data that is more applicable to the environment we are working in. This would be a good goal to have should we go ahead and try to implement our own local LLM for the class environment.
